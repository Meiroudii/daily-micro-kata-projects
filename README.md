# daily-micro-kata-projects
It's very interesting to apply the kata movements from real world into programming.

## TELOS

The goal is to memorize(yes you heard it, we're going to apply the 'hard way principle' and 'blind method')
If you're going to memorize the code generated from LLMs make sure to validate it and ask for the best practices since you're going to drill that code everyday.

When you memorized the code snippet, it's now your turn to modify it and see the docs of the langauge of your choice and apply all the ideas you're learned.

> TLDR: MEMORIZE > WHEN COMFORTABLE > MODIFY IT > read :TLDR

## REQUIRED RULES

In order for you to benefit from this system, you're going to abide these:
1. Turn off all auto completion, AI suggestions, and other Aim Assist Systems.
2. Write it daily.
3. READ REQUIRED RULES


## Skepticism and Frequently Ask Questions

<ol>
    <li>Why?<br>
...Are you really a programmer?
    </li>
    <li>Is there a directory sturcture should I follow?<br>
Um...no, You can follow my directory structure which is:
<br>
<div style="text-align: center; background: black; color: green;">
project_name_dailes {
    project_name1.rb
    project_name2.rb
    project_name3.py
}
</div>
<br>
But at the end of the day it's up to you.
Also, you can apply the bind method by creating new file to write from your human brain.
<br>
<div style="text-align: center; background: black; color: green;">
http_server_dailes {
    HTTP12.c
    HTTP12_2.c
    HTTP12_3.c
    ...
}
</div>
<br>
Notice the `_n`?, That's your attempt from newly learned and memorized code snippet. (If it's hard for you to grasp, you can check my own directories to get some insights of my approach.)
    </li>
    <li>What if I want to write {SNS,SaaS,PaaS} clones?<br>
The goal of this system is to write micro projects, but you can. It's possible to apply the system if you have really a deep commitment to your craft, here's my recommend directory structure for ya.
<br>
<div style="text-align: center; background: black; color: green;">
project_name_clone_dailes {
    project_name1
    project_name2
    project_name3
}
</div>
    </li>
</ol>

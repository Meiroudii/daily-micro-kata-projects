The goal is to memorize(yes you heard it, we're going to apply the 'hard way principle' and 'blind method')
If you're going to memorize the code generated from LLMs make sure to validate it and ask for the best practices since you're going to drill that code everyday.

When you memorized the code snippet, it's now your turn to modify it and see the docs of the langauge of your choice and apply all the ideas you're learned.

TLDR: MEMORIZE > WHEN COMFORTABLE > MODIFY IT > read :TLDR
